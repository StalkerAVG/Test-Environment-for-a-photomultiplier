# Test-Environment-for-a-photomultiplier
## Project Overview
Setting up an automated test environment in NI TestStand for photomultiplier tube (PMT) characterization and validation as part of the Design Laboratory course project.

## Team Information
- **Course**: Design Laboratory 2025
- **Instructor**: Sebastian Koryciak (koryciak@agh.edu.pl)
- **Project**: PMT Testing with NI TestStand
- **Team**: Artem Kmet, Adam Kruszec

## Project Goal
Create a test environment using NI TestStand to automate the testing and characterization of photomultiplier tubes.

## Hardware Setup
> **📝 To be documented:** Laboratory equipment specifications and connections

Probable expected components:
- Photomultiplier tube (PMT)
- High voltage power supply
- Optical source (laser/LED)
- Signal acquisition system
- Measurement instruments

## Test Parameters
> **📝 To be defined after consulation**
